Contributions back to the source are encouraged.

The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) is currently maintained by [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/) as
an [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) installation framework but is prepared to be a much broader function tool. It was
originally developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack).

A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar. Core barclamps operate the essential
functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

**This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required**
